        <ul>
            <li>3 pounds bone-in, skin on chicken (thighs and/or drumsticks)</li>
            <li>1 orange</li>
            <li>1 lime</li>
            <li>1 small red or yellow onion, coarsely chopped</li>
            <li>4 garlic cloves, chopped</li>
            <li>1 (2-inch) piece of fresh ginger, chopped</li>
            <li>3 Scotch bonnet peppers, stemmed and cut in half (see notes)</li>
            <li>4 green onions (scallions) white and green parts, 
                coarsely chopped (plus more for garnish)
            </li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons fresh thyme leaves</li>
            <li>1 1/2 Tablespoon ground Allspice</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon cinnamon powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon paprika</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons brown sugar</li>
            <li>3 Tablespoons Soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon Kosher salt (adjust to taste)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper (adjust to taste)</li>
            <li>1-2 limes, sliced into wedges for serving (optional)</li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Pat dry chicken pieces with paper towels and use a fork or 
                small sharp knife to poke holes throughout all the pieces. This will allow the seasoning to soak in. 
                Place chicken in a large glass mixing bowl or large zip lock bag.
            </li>
            <li>Using a vegetable peeler, peel 5 (3-inch-long) strips of orange zest, then roughly chop the zest. 
                Repeat this with the lime, but zest the whole lime. Juice half of the orange and the entire lime; 
                add the zest and juice to the bowl of a food processor or blender.
            </li>
            <li>To the food processor (or blender) add the onion, garlic, ginger, scotch bonnets, scallions, thyme leaves, allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg, paprika, brown sugar, soy sauce, vinegar, olive oil, salt and pepper. 
                Alternatively, chop all ingredients finely by hand or use mortar and pestle.
            </li>
            <li>Pour the marinade over the chicken, holding back about 1/2 cup to use for basting. 
                Using gloves, rub the marinade into chicken; really rub it in—under the skin as well, 
                so the chicken is well-seasoned throughout. Cover and let marinate in the fridge for at 
                least 2 hours and up to overnight. Remove the chicken from the fridge 30 minutes before 
                you're going to cook it.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat a grill to medium-high heat. If possible leave one burner on medium low— if the chicken is browning too quickly, you can move it to that side. 
                Clean and lightly oil the grates. Remove chicken from the marinade and discard the marinade.
            </li>
            <li>Place the chicken pieces on the grill and cook for about 15 minutes, turning once every 5 minutes or so. 
                When the chicken skin starts to crisp and darken, move the pieces to the cooler side of the grill and 
                let them cook for 15 to 20 minutes more, or until internal temperature is 165ºF – 170ºF. 
                To finish, move the chicken back onto the hot side of the grill and baste with reserved marinade, turning the pieces a few more times. 
                <strong>TIP:</strong> You’ll want to move the pieces around on the grill to keep them from burning, and flip them often, as well.
            </li>
            <li><strong>To bake the chicken:</strong>Preheat oven to 425ºF. Place chicken pieces on a parchment-lined baking 
                sheet. Bake until chicken is golden brown and cooked through, 40 to 45 minutes. Internal temperature should read 165ºF – 170ºF.
            </li>
            <li>Garnish chicken with chopped scallions and serve with lime wedges on the side.</li>
        </ol>
