        <h3>For the Spinners (Optional) and to Finish:</h3>

            <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (6 3/4 ounces; 191 g)</li>

        </ul>



        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>For the Marinated Oxtail:</strong>In a blender, combine onion, scallion, garlic, and Scotch bonnet with 1/2 cup (120ml) water and blend until thoroughly pureed. 
            Rub oxtail all over with soy sauce, salt, pepper, and thyme. Transfer oxtail to a large bowl or large zipper-lock bag and pour blended aromatics on top. 
            Mix well to coat, then cover bowl or seal bag, pushing out air as you go. Refrigerate for 24 hours.
            </li>
            <li>Remove oxtail from marinade and scrape off excess marinade. Reserve marinade for later use.</li>
            <li><strong>For the Stew:</strong>In a Dutch oven, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. 
                Working in batches to avoid crowding the pot, add oxtail and cook until browned all over, about 5 minutes per side (oxtail will brown more quickly and deeply due to the marinade, but turn down heat if it threatens to burn). 
                Transfer oxtail to a platter and repeat with remaining oxtail, adding more oil to the pot if necessary.
            </li>
            <li>Add 1 cup (240ml) water to Dutch oven and bring to a simmer, scraping bottom of pot to remove any browned bits. Return oxtail and any juices to the pot.</li>
            <li>Add onions, scallion, garlic, thyme, Scotch bonnet pepper, and browning or soy sauce to oxtail. 
                Add just enough water to cover meat, bring to a simmer, then reduce heat, cover, and let simmer for 40 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Add reserved oxtail marinade to pot and stir to combine. 
                Continue to gently simmer, uncovered, adding a little water from time to time to ensure oxtail remains just barely covered, 
                until oxtail is tender, about 2 hours.
            </li>
            <li><strong>For the Spinners (Optional) and to Finish:</strong>If making spinners: In a small bowl, whisk together flour and a large pinch of salt. 
                Add 1/2 cup (118ml) cold water and knead until a sticky dough ball forms. 
                Cover and let rest 15 minutes. Tear off small pieces of dough and roll them into cigarette-sized strips. 
                Stir into oxtail.
            </li>
            <li>Stir in butter or broad beans and let simmer until stew is thickened, about 30 minutes. Remove thyme sprigs.</li>
            <li>Add black pepper, season with salt, and serve with white rice or rice and peas, plantain, sliced avocado, and a nice fresh green salad.</li>
        </ol>
